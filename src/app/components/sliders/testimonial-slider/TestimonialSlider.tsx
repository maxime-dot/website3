                  Â« We greatly appreciate having you all with us as well. We all
                  seem to not only work well together which is important, but
                  any of our requests, your group jumps right in without
                  hesitation. Pety has been helping out with some systems stuff
                  and I think has even been learning a little on that end
                  overall for myself, I know I have learned a lot from the
                  group. Beyond client/developer relations, I do enjoy and value
                  the unique partnership we all have formed and think it is
                  great when we can also pick up knowledge along the way ðŸ™‚ Â».
