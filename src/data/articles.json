He also addressed students' questions about the advantages of pursuing the software and database track, the academic path he followed, and why studying at ENI (National School of Computer Science) is advantageous. Students were encouraged to complete the projects assigned by teachers and to go above and beyond.He also emphasized that each individual is responsible for their own decisions, highlighting the importance of not solely relying on others but considering others' opinions as suggestions. Don't wait for others to answer your questions; you must conduct research on your own.",

Last Saturday, the entire team went to recharge in a quiet corner of Sahambavy.We chose to spend this day doing activities away from computers and our daily routine. As we love adventure, we decided to take a bike ride to Sahambavy. The departure was at 7 a.m. at the AKATA Isaha Fianarantsoa headquarters, and we had breakfast in Ambalakely around 8 a.m. It was a mix of \"gasy gasy\" dishes: mofo gasy, mena kely, tea, milk, and coffee. To capture the moment, we took some photos.Once we arrived in Sahambavy at 9:30 a.m., we had a small snack because pedaling was not easy. We stayed on the \"gasy\" theme and enjoyed eating \"balamboay,\" which is a typical Betsileo donut. Feeling revitalized, we visited some places on-site before heading to Lake Hotel Sahambavy.It's 12:00, and here we are, but before eating, should we do some fun activities, right? We did a lot of things: motorboat, pedal boat, ping pong, foosball, card games, not to mention the photo shoot... Then, at 1 p.m., it's lunchtime. The dishes were specially chosen to honor this moment: pork, turkey, and fish. It was really delicious because the dishes were prepared by competent chefs. We want to thank \"Lake Hotel Sahambavy\" for its hospitality, even if the rice was not enough, we were really hungry after hours of physical activities.As the day was almost over, we returned to Fianarantsoa around 4 p.m. But this is not the end of our adventure. We arrived in Fianarantsoa around 6 p.m. and took a short break at \"La Gastronomie Pizza.\" It was a moment of sharing over a drink and pizzas. Then, everyone went home around 7 p.m. It was a day of celebration, fun, and relaxation.",
